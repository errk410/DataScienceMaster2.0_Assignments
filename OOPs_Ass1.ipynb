        "**Ans:** The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming are:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Encapsulation:** This principle involves bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It restricts access to some of the object's components, hiding the internal details while providing an interface for interacting with the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inheritance:** Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an existing class (base class or superclass). It promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Polymorphism:** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables objects to take on multiple forms and allows functions or methods to work with objects of different types through method overriding and method overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Abstraction:** Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable parts. In OOP, it involves creating abstract classes or interfaces that define a set of methods without specifying their implementation. It provides a high-level view of an object's functionality."

This function is automatically called when an object is instantiated, allowing you to set initial values for the object's attributes."
