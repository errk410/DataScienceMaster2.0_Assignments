        "**Ans:** **Abstraction** is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It refers to the concept of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors while hiding the unnecessary details. Abstraction allows us to create abstract classes or interfaces that define a set of methods without specifying their implementation. It provides a high-level view of an object's functionality."
